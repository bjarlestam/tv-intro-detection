# Running The Scripts

1. Install python3 (tested with 3.8.9+)
2. Install ffmpeg
3. Install python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
5. To process a directory, run `decode.py` and pass the parameter `-i` with the path to a directory containing at least **two** episodes of the same season

By default there is little/no output to stdout or stderr until the script has finished processing some media. Run `decode.py` with the `-d` parameter for verbose output
